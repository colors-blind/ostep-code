# Question 4

Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is
-S, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to SWITCH ON END, the system
will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (-l 1:0,4:100
-c -S SWITCH ON END), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU
work?


```bash
lovezx@parrot ~/D/o/H/C/HW-CPU-Intro> python process-run.py -S SWITCH_ON_END -l 1:0,4:100 -c -p
